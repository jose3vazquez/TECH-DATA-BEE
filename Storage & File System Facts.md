# **ðŸ’¾ Storage & File System Facts**

1. **ExFAT** works seamlessly on both macOS and Windows â€” perfect for portable drives.  
2. **NTFS** is native to Windows; macOS can read it, but can't write without third-party drivers.  
3. **APFS (Apple File System)** is macOS-native â€” not supported on Windows without special tools.  
4. **FAT32** works across nearly all systems but has a **4GB per-file size limit**.  
5. **exFAT** overcomes FAT32â€™s file size limit and supports large files.  
6. **SSD (Solid-State Drive)** uses flash memory â€” no moving parts, much faster than HDDs.  
7. **HDD (Hard Disk Drive)** uses spinning disks â€” typically cheaper and better for large, infrequently accessed storage.  
8. **SSDs do wear out**, but slowly â€” modern drives handle years of daily use.  
9. **TRIM** helps SSDs by clearing deleted blocks to maintain speed and efficiency.  
10. **M.2 and NVMe SSDs** plug directly into the motherboard â€” far faster than SATA SSDs.
