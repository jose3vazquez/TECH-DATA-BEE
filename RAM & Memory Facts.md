# **🧠 RAM & Memory Facts**

11. **RAM is volatile** — all data is lost when the system powers off.  
12. **More RAM won’t make your system “faster” by itself**, but it enables better multitasking.  
13. **DDR4 and DDR5** are the current RAM types — DDR5 is newer and faster, but pricier.  
14. RAM must match your **motherboard’s supported type, speed, and voltage**.  
15. When RAM is full, systems use **virtual memory** (e.g., swapfile on macOS, pagefile on Windows).  
16. **RAM is not storage** — it’s a temporary workspace, not long-term memory.
