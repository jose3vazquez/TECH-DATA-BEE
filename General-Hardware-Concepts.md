# **ðŸ’¡ General Hardware Concepts**

33. A **bus** is a pathway for data â€” examples include PCIe, SATA, and USB.  
34. **PCIe 4.0 and 5.0** offer faster data transfer than earlier generations â€” used in GPUs, SSDs, etc.  
35. **BIOS/UEFI** is low-level firmware that initializes hardware before booting the OS.  
36. You can **boot from a USB** to install or troubleshoot an operating system.  
37. **POST (Power-On Self-Test)** checks basic hardware during startup.  
38. **Peripherals** are external components like a keyboard, mouse, or printer.  
39. **macOS supports most external devices** â€” even if theyâ€™re designed for Windows.  
40. Many modern **Macs rely on passive cooling** â€” no fans, just thermal efficiency.
