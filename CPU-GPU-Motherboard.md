# **ðŸ§© CPU, GPU & Motherboard**

27. **CPU (Central Processing Unit)** is the brain of the computer.  
28. **Apple Silicon (M1, M2)** uses **ARM architecture**, unlike Intel's **x86**.  
29. **Integrated graphics** live inside the CPU â€” fine for light use, not heavy gaming.  
30. **Dedicated GPUs** (like NVIDIA/AMD) have their own memory and power for high-performance tasks.  
31. The **motherboard connects everything** â€” its chipset defines compatibility and features.  
32. **Heat sinks and fans** are crucial â€” even non-moving components generate heat.
